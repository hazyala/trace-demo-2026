# Shared student workspace contract

Both **2학년 네트워크 실습** and **융합 팀 프로젝트** use `StudentWorkspace`, `WorkspaceSidebar`, `navigation.ts`, `KnowledgeConnections`, `ProjectSimulation`, and `TeamDocuments`. `scenarios.ts` supplies their different content. Corresponding screens, cards, fields, navigation labels, and workflows remain identical. `DESIGN.md` and `.impeccable/design.json` are preserved.

## Role and navigation

The anchored profile disclosure switches between 강병준 (teacher) and 유송민 (student, team 1); the workspace disclosure selects network or fusion. They are keyboard-operable disclosures with current-choice state, outside dismissal, and Escape handling. Profiles are demonstration roles, not authenticated accounts. The shared sidebar retains TRACE, green navigation, charcoal active rows, collapse behavior, and the tablet drawer.

| Route | Common purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `team` · 팀 대시보드 | Brief, five phases, task progress, plan, learning need, team roles, teacher guidance, knowledge connections, and resources |
| `studio` · 프로젝트 작업실 | 기획·기술 선택 → 수행 보드 → 실행 및 검증 tabs |
| `documents` · 팀 자료 | Search/filter, create/edit, attach, download, and share a resource |
| `chat` · 팀 채팅 | Team-visible local messages and clickable shared resources |
| `ai` · 개인 AI 지원 | Private scripted guidance, current work context, and an explicit teacher-guidance request |
| `learning` · 나의 학습 기록 | Personal evidence, prior-learning gap, connections, teacher guidance, and saved assessment feedback |

Active role, route, and studio tab survive workspace switching within the app session. Reload starts with the default teacher/network context. Local form drafts and open dialogs do not have the same persistence guarantee as saved records.

## Planning, connections, and work board

The planning form has the same fields in both scenarios: name, audience, problem, minimum scope, language/command system, interface/configuration tool, processing/connection approach, collaboration tools, and the reason connecting existing/new knowledge. Saving requires every field and creates a personal design-process evidence record.

`KnowledgeConnections` shows learning source, existing knowledge, new need, application/checking action, and status. Students can add a named connection with its source and intended use from planning or learning records. Network connects address/routing/diagnosis/documentation knowledge; fusion connects prior and other coursework with the chosen program. The component and edit form are shared.

The work board has 할 일, 진행 중, 완료 columns and six scenario tasks. A nonblank action/result note completes the selected task and appends evidence attributed to 유송민. Progress is completed tasks divided by six, not a grade or proof that code ran. Recording a task does not bypass the execution panel's verification gate. Other members' activity is authored demonstration data.

## Shared execution and verification

Both scenarios use the same composition: project nodes, two checking conditions, target selector, bounded command/request console, shortcuts, three result checks, and written explanation before sharing. The console retains the latest 40 entries. No command runs on real equipment, the operating system, or an external API.

Network data describes PC-A `192.168.10.10` → R1 `10.0.0.1` → R2 `10.0.0.2` → PC-B `192.168.20.10`. R2 initially has the wrong next hop `10.0.0.9`. Supported route/interface inspection, the exact R2 repair `ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1`, and the two directional PC ping checks model a small diagnostic exercise. A repair resets current directional checks. Students must select the comparison/return-direction conditions and pass the route plus both directional checks.

Fusion uses `GET /schema`, `GET /status`, `TEST registered`, `TEST unknown`, and `TEST privacy`. Registered questions return an authored answer/source. Missing-source and personal-information tests depend on the abstention and masking rules. Fictional outputs do not establish real correctness or privacy protection.

Changing either condition clears current checks in both scenarios. Sharing requires all three current checks, both selected conditions, and a nonblank judgment. It stores the explanation and a verification evidence record, completes the test task, updates or creates resource ID `project-verification`, and appends a team announcement. Re-sharing updates the resource body/version and replaces the prior simulation evidence record; earlier shared evidence remains a snapshot until explicitly shared again. Completing all board tasks and passing the simulated experiment remain separate concepts.

## Private support and shared guidance

Team messages and private AI messages use separate arrays. The student sees no L1–L4 control; scenario keyword rules choose an illustrative response and store a guidance level/topic/time summary. Navigation and role switching clear unsent composer text. Responses are scripted examples, not a model service.

Teachers receive guidance summaries, explicit requests, and shared evidence, never private conversation text. Students send a separate written request when they want teacher review. Saving a teacher guidance proposal for team 1 makes its text visible on the student's dashboard, support view, and learning record. A new student request makes the previous response inactive. Saved evaluation feedback for 유송민 also appears in the learning record. These interactions share local state in the selected scenario; they are not messages sent through an institutional service.

## Materials and storage

`TeamDocuments` supports text creation/editing, version counters, search/type filtering, local attachments, downloads, and chat links. File attachments are read locally into data URLs, with a 2 MiB per-file limit and a serialized student-state size check. Version numbers do not preserve historical revisions. Chat resource links open the current resource. This is not concurrent collaboration, server upload, document parsing, or cross-device synchronization.

Saved project data uses `trace-project-network-v2` or `trace-project-fusion-v2`. It includes plan, connections, tasks, evidence, experiment explanation, materials, conversations, guidance summaries, requests, and shared feedback. Legacy student/fusion keys can seed migration but are no longer the write targets. Teacher course, assignment, evidence-confirmation, and review keys are separately scoped with `workspaceKey`; see [the common scenario contract](fusion-workspace.md).

Explicit save/send/share actions distinguish drafts from saved records. Simulation rules, current checks, command history, open dialogs, work notes, and unsaved input remain transient. Browser storage failure displays a warning. Private-text separation is an interface boundary within browser storage, not server authorization.

## Visual and verification boundary

The common workspace inherits the existing palette, rounded white panels, compact Korean typography, focus states, tablet drawer, and reduced-motion behavior. Student and studio composition uses the existing student/fusion styles for both data variants. No global visual tokens change. Documentation was checked against the shared source components; runtime tests and screenshot review are separate validation work.
